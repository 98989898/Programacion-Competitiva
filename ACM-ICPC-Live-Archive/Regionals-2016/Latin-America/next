Next Problems:
Penguins-Inverse DFS/BFS (Cardozo
Cardiologist-Dynamic Programming
D-Pure Geometry, perhaps convex hull
H-Permutations(letter frequencies) of continous subarrays
J-Special String Matching Problem
K-Find maximal paths (Graphs)

What we learned:
1.) Orthogonal projection is defined in convex hull
2.) Geometry is no underrepresented
3.) Complete, memorize, and understand convexhull (Complete point in polygon.
4.) Work problems up to a lower more deep level

To look forward:
1.) Code made or revisited by two people line by line is less prone to errors and better debugged.
